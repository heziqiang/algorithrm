49. Group Anagrams
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Explanation:
There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
*/

/*
Approach: Use a Map to store sorted string as key, and the list of anagrams as value.

Time complexity: O(n * k * log(k)), n is the length of strs, k is the max length of string in strs.
  quick sort takes O(k * log(k)) time.
Space complexity: O(n * k)s
*/

function groupAnagrams(strs) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let str of strs) {
    const sorted = str.split('').sort().join('');
    if (!map.has(sorted)) {
      map.set(sorted, []);
    }
    map.get(sorted).push(str);
  }
  return [...map.values()];
}

// Test
console.log(groupAnagrams(['eat', 'tea', 'tan', 'ate', 'nat', 'bat'])); // [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
console.log(groupAnagrams([''])); // [['']]
